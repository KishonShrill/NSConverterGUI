## Description

The Number Conversion App is a simple tool that allows users to convert numbers into different numeral systems such as binary (bin), octal (oct), decimal (dec), and hexadecimal (hex). The app provides both the numerical representation of the converted numbers and a solution table for easy reference.

## How to Use

Before you open the app, download the latest Java version [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and click "Download Java".

- Launch the Number Conversion App.
- Enter a number in the input field.
- Click the "Convert" button.

## Conversion Results

Once you click the "Convert" button, the app will display the converted numbers in the following formats:

- Binary (bin): The binary representation of the input number.
- Octal (oct): The octal representation of the input number.
- Decimal (dec): The decimal representation of the input number.
- Hexadecimal (hex): The hexadecimal representation of the input number.

## Solution Table

In addition to the numerical representations, the Number Conversion App also presents a solution table. The table provides a side-by-side comparison of the converted numbers in bin, oct, dec, and hex formats. This table makes it easier to understand and compare the different numeral systems.

Here's an example of the solution table:

| Number System     | Representation  |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Binary (bin)      | 101010          |
| Octal (oct)       | 52              |
| Decimal (dec)     | 42              |
| Hexadecimal (hex) | 2A              |

The solution table allows you to quickly see the conversions and facilitates a better understanding of how the input number translates into different numeral systems.

Feel free to explore and use the Number Conversion App for your numerical conversion needs!
